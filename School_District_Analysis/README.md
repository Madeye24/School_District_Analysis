School Analysis using Python [Pandas library]

# Background:
Assisting Maria, the chief data scientist for a city school district.
Maria is responsible for analyzing information from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats.
In this role, she is tasked with preparing all standardized test data for analysis, reporting, and presentation to provide insights about performance trends and patterns.

# Our Analysis:
We will be helping Maria analyze data on student funding and students' standardized test scores, "reading and math scores" in particular", from each school.
Our task is to aggregate the data and showcase trends in school performance.

## Key Findings and Final Comments:
* Our task was to aggregate school data and showcase the trends in school performances. 
* In our initial analysis in the module, Maria was pleased with the descriptive analysis; however,
* There were some discrepancies due to two variables "math score" and "reading score" that had null values.
* Maria wanted to make sure that the data is not skewed and our analysis results are not impacted by the null values. So we used the dropna function
* Our findings ahow that the public school budget is > than the charter school budget.
* We can dig deeper, and compare students in same grades but in different school system.
* Overall, pandas is a friendly library and it helped us summarizing basic statistics and made our findings alot easier.
